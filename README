NAME
    Dancer::Logger::File::PerRequest - per-request file-based logging engine
    for Dancer

SYNOPSIS
        ## in yml config
        logger: "File::PerRequest"

DESCRIPTION
    Dancer::Logger::File::PerRequest is a per-request file-based logging
    engine for Dancer.

  logfile_callback
    By default, it will be generating YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_$pid.log under logs of
    application dir.

    the stuff can be configured as

    *   per pid

            set 'logfile_callback' => sub {
                return $$ . '.log';
            };

        will genereate $pid.log

    *   per hour

            set 'logfile_callback' => sub {
                my @d = localtime();
                my $file = sprintf('%04d%02d%02d%02d', $d[5] + 1900, $d[4] + 1, $d[3], $d[2]);
                return $file . '.log';
            };

        will do file as YYYYMMDDHH.log

    it's quite flexible that you can configure it as daily or daily + pid +
    server or whatever.

  log_path
    the log path, same as Dancer::Logger::File, default to $appdir/logs
