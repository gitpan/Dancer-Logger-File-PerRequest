NAME
    Dancer::Logger::File::PerRequest - per-request file-based logging engine
    for Dancer

SYNOPSIS
        ## in yml config
        logger: "File::PerRequest"

DESCRIPTION
    Dancer::Logger::File::PerRequest is a per-request file-based logging
    engine for Dancer.

  SETTINGS
   logfile_callback
    By default, it will be generating YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-$pid-$request_id.log
    under logs of application dir.

    the stuff can be configured as

    *   per pid

            set 'logfile_callback' => sub {
                return $$ . '.log';
            };

        will genereate $pid.log

    *   per hour

            set 'logfile_callback' => sub {
                my @d = localtime();
                my $file = sprintf('%04d%02d%02d%02d', $d[5] + 1900, $d[4] + 1, $d[3], $d[2]);
                return $file . '.log';
            };

        will do file as YYYYMMDDHH.log

    it's quite flexible that you can configure it as daily or daily + pid +
    server or whatever.

   log_path
    the log path, same as Dancer::Logger::File, default to $appdir/logs

  HOOKS
   before_file_per_request_close
        hook 'before_file_per_request_close' => sub {
            my ($fh, $logfile) = @_;

            print $fh "# END on " . scalar(localtime()) . "\n";
        };

   after_file_per_request_close
        hook 'after_file_per_request_close' => sub {
            my ($logfile, $response) = @_;

            # response as Dancer::Response
            if ($response->status >= 500) { ## server error
                # move file to error dir
            } else {
                # just rm it?
                unlink($logfile);
            }
        };
